TODO
  - [ ] automerge does not work. it triggers after base repo merges but gets error
  - [x] need to validate pr process and it works properly. (simple examples work. comment formatting is off and needs love)
  - [x] check to see if no submodules if it still works. (works) 
  - [ ] what about multiple submodules?
  - [ ] fix comment formatting
  - [ ] scalability? is polling a good option every 5 minutes?
